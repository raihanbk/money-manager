 Personal Money Manager is a simple Flutter application designed to help users manage their finances conveniently on their mobile devices. The app features a clean and intuitive user interface with two main screens: Transaction and Category screens. Users can categorize their expenses and incomes, view their transaction history, and track their financial activities effortlessly.
 Features:
Transaction Screen: Allows users to add, edit, and delete transactions, including both expenses and incomes. Each transaction is categorized and displayed in a chronological list.
Category Screen: Provides users with a list of predefined categories for organizing their transactions. Users can also customize and add new categories to suit their needs.
